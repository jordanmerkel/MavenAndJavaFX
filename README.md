# MavenAndJavaFX
Maven + JavaFX

The project/homework assignment was allowed to be uploaded, courtesy of Prof. Thomas Rossi.
My code may NOT be used in any of his(Prof. Rossi) assignements.

The purpose of this assignment was using everything I've learned in Java. I used Maven, JavaFX, and SQLite in this assignment. 
I was to open up the database that was given. Then search through the databse containing country names and update the entries as needed.
